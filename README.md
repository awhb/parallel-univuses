MILESTONE 1 SUBMISSION

Team Name: 
shAPE yoUR futuRE

Proposed Level of Achievement: 
Apollo 11

Motivation: 
Many university students believe that the first year of university may perhaps be the most important. After all, you take your first modules under your major(s), form your friend groups, and the outcomes carry through to the rest of your university life. It is thus only natural to wonder what could have happened if one made a different choice that year. After all, everyone only gets one chance and we can only hope that each choice we make is the right one. Maybe if we switched majors early, focussed more on our grades, confessed before it was too late, or took up more commitments, we would be living the dream life in university! 
Presenting our proposed choose-your-adventure narrative game “Parallel uNivUSes”, where you can now re-live “what could’ve been”. For an infinite number of times, players can go through iterations of first year NUS student life and shape the outcomes of these lives through their choices. Players will hopefully understand more about various struggles of student life and how they, as students, can make the most out of their university experience based on their own personalities and values.
With individualised and simulated experiences, players will inevitably reflect on their existing lifestyles and decide if they are content, and make changes accordingly otherwise. Rather than daydream about the grass being greener on the other side, why not play the game to find out?
